## Deep Learning Framework Power Scores 2018
Author Jeff Hale has built a “power score” ranking of deep learning frameworks:

> I used 11 data sources across 7 distinct categories to gauge framework usage, interest, and popularity. Then I weighted and combined the data…

The final results are in the chart above. Data sources include:
* KDnuggets Usage Survey
* Google Search Volume
* Medium Articles
* Amazon Books
* ArXiv Articles
* GitHub Activity

If you’re starting a new deep learning project, by all means, choose your framework based on technical requirements. But if you’re curious about adoption / popularity, this is a solid benchmark. Users exert gravity in winner-take-all technology ecosystems; I expect the top frameworks to only become more popular and more feature-rich as the space matures.
