The design and implementation of modern column-oriented database systems
Have you ever found yourself answering the question “But why is Redshift (or Snowflake or Bigquery, etc) faster than Postgres?” I answer this question a lot—multiple times a week. This is the single best answer to that question I’ve ever seen, and it goes deep into topics like column pruning and compression. Dense; very worthwhile.
