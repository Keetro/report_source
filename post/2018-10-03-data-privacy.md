**Spotify: Scalable User Privacy**

> One of the standards we have set at Spotify is that personal data of our users can only be persisted when it is encrypted.

Wow. Just think about that for a second: every single piece of at-rest data associated with a user is encrypted throughout Spotifyâ€™s entire infrastructure. Thousands of microservices, thousands of datasets.
This article is a fascinating internal look at how a company that is committed to user privacy architects their data systems. While this strategy is probably not within reach for most of you today, the behind-the-scenes look at how a leading company does this is invaluable.
