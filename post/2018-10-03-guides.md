## A Beginner’s Guide to Data Engineering — The Series Finale
Wow. This piece is a must-read. More than any other blog post that I’ve read in the recent past, this post gives outsiders a glimpse into what it’s like to work in data at a large company with a deep investment in data. 

Companies like Airbnb and Spotify and Uber have invested heavily in their own proprietary data tooling that data scientists use to do things like building tables incrementally, backfilling data, and experimentation. The author is from Airbnb, and the post focuses on the the tooling that all data scientists at Airbnb have access to.

Having this type of infrastructure is a massive leg up for data scientists who want to make a big impact, and it’s a major reason why data jobs at these companies are so highly sought-after.
