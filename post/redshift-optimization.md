## Top 14 Performance Tuning Tips for Amazon Redshift
This is the single best post Iâ€™ve read on Redshift optimization. Itâ€™s written by the co-founder of Intermix, a company that specializes in (you guessed it) helping companies optimize their Redshift performance. It covers everything from table design to workload management config to query optimization. Very comprehensive advice you wonâ€™t find elsewhere.

My only critique of this post is that it doesnâ€™t mention my favorite trick for optimizing Redshift performance: migrating to Snowflake! ðŸ˜‰
