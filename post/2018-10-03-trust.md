## Trustworthy Data Analysis
I love this post, and this line in particular:

> Almost all presentations are incomplete because for any analysis of reasonable size, some details must be omitted for the sake of clarity. 

Presenting one’s analysis is an important part of the analytical process, and because presentation nearly always involves summarizing information content, analysts have to make choices about what information to include and what to exclude. This is where trust comes in: does your audience trust the choices you’ve made? Have you done the work, just chosen not to present it? Or have you not actually done the work?
This is a foundational, how-to-think-about-your-job-better, post.
