## SQL Interview Questions for Data Analysts
> The most feared part of the hiring data analyst/scientist process is the technical screening. Here are 3 SQL interview questions to practice.

Or, if you’re hiring, here are 3 example interview questions to give to your candidates.

Really, I wouldn’t recommend using exactly these questions, but I do highly recommend giving technical screens for analyst positions. Frequently data scientist positions get hit by massive tech screens, but analyst positions get almost none. This should be fixed: analysts need a baseline level of technical aptitude before starting on day 1, and 100% of those skills can be learned online via excellent free classes today. The tech screen is almost more about motivation than anything—if the candidate cares about the position they can learn the skills required to pass the screen in a small # of hours.

We do this for 100% of our applicants.

## SQL Window Functions to Pass a Data Analytics Interview
Alternate title: Window Functions Can Do More Than You Thought. There’s a lot of good stuff in this post, but my favorite was the trailing 4-week confidence interval. That’s right: you can calculate confidence intervals in analytic SQL!

## Red Flags in Data Science Interviews
This is kind of a different viewpoint from what the above two articles attempt to get at. Here Emily Robinson, a former Data Scientist/Analyst at Etsy, talks from the perspective of an interviewee. It is useful feedback for any teams jumpstarting their interviews.

## Data Science Interview Questions / Answers
Not sure anyone really claim that certain questions are a must-know for any DS interview--the field is just way to diverse for that. And yet, this is another useful reference data point. What I like about this is that some questions are more social rather than quantitative - very important from the communication perspective.
