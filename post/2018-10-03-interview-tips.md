## SQL Interview Questions for Data Analysts
> The most feared part of the hiring data analyst/scientist process is the technical screening. Here are 3 SQL interview questions to practice.

Or, if you’re hiring, here are 3 example interview questions to give to your candidates.

Really, I wouldn’t recommend using exactly these questions, but I do highly recommend giving technical screens for analyst positions. Frequently data scientist positions get hit by massive tech screens, but analyst positions get almost none. This should be fixed: analysts need a baseline level of technical aptitude before starting on day 1, and 100% of those skills can be learned online via excellent free classes today. The tech screen is almost more about motivation than anything—if the candidate cares about the position they can learn the skills required to pass the screen in a small # of hours.

We do this for 100% of our applicants.
