## 9 Things You Should Know About TensorFlow
I feel a little bad about linking to this because it’s such a clear advertisement for TF. But…it’s a good post and a quick read. I actually didn’t realize they had added an eager execution environment! From the docs:

> TensorFlow’s eager execution is an imperative programming environment that evaluates operations immediately, without building graphs: operations return concrete values instead of constructing a computational graph to run later.

Seems like a really significant ease-of-use improvement. Many other useful tidbits in the post.

## Twitter meets TensorFlow
> In this blog post, we will discuss the history, evolution, and future of our modeling/testing/serving framework, internally referred to as Deepbird, applying ML to Twitter data, and the challenges of serving ML in production settings.

Long, detailed post about the history of ML @ Twitter. Worthwhile to see the trajectory—if your company is going through the ML learning curve today, there are plenty of lessons. Technical.
