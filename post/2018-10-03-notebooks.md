## Beyond Interactive: Notebook Innovation at Netflix
Oh snap…this is awesome.
> Notebooks have rapidly grown in popularity among data scientists to become the de facto standard for quick prototyping and exploratory analysis. At Netflix, we’re pushing the boundaries even further, reimagining what a notebook can be, who can use it, and what they can do with it. And we’re making big investments to help make this vision a reality.
In this post, we’ll share our motivations and why we find Jupyter notebooks so compelling. We’ll also introduce components of our notebook infrastructure and explore some of the novel ways we’re using notebooks at Netflix.

The post is long, but well worth it. I hadn’t read about any company with quite such an extensive investment in Jupyter before. Very impressive. Make sure to check out the Notebook Infrastructure section—several tools in there worth checking out.
