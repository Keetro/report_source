## Stitch Fix: Add Constrained Optimization To Your Toolbelt

> This post is an introduction to constrained optimization aimed at data scientists and developers fluent in Python, but without any background in operations research or applied math. We’ll demonstrate how optimization modeling can be applied to real problems at Stitch Fix. At the end of this article, you should be able to start modeling your own business problems.

This post is a great intro to a surprisingly underutilized technique. I personally don’t see many companies attempting to answer “how can I perform this process X% better” using data science—I see data science being more commonly used today to classify and predict.

Think about the problems in your org. Can you frame any of them as constrained optimization problems?
