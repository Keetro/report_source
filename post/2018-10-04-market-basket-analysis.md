A thorough coverage of what basket analysis is as well as how to perform it using SQL, R, and a relational DB (Postgres/Redshift in this example). Directly from Yali's introduction:

> [Affinity analysis] affinity-analysis 347 and [association rule learning] association-rule-learning 249 encompasses a broad set of analytics techniques aimed at uncovering the associations and connections between specific objects: these might be visitors to your website (customers or audience), products in your store, or content items on your media site. Of these, “market basket analysis” is perhaps the most famous example. In a market basket analysis, you look to see if there are combinations of products that frequently co-occur in transactions. For example, maybe people who buy flour and casting sugar, also tend to buy eggs (because a high proportion of them are planning on baking a cake). A retailer can use this information to inform:

> Store layout (put products that co-occur together close to one another, to improve the customer shopping experience)
* Marketing (e.g. target customers who buy flour with offers on eggs, to encourage them to spend more on their shopping basket)
* Online retailers and publishers can use this type of analysis to:

> Inform the placement of content items on their media sites, or products in their catalogue:
* Drive recommendation engines (like Amazon’s customers who bought this product also bought these products…)
* Deliver targeted marketing (e.g. emailing customers who bought products specific products with other products and offers on those products that are likely to be interesting to them.)
