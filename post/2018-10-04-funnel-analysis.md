Funnels are the core of any analytical tool. However, the simplicity of visualizations often hide the true complexity and assumptions underlying by each funnel framework. In this Snowplow article the author demonstrates these assumptions through raw SQL in order to showcase how funnel analytics can make use of the data collected through Snowplow's event collection engine. No pretty pictures - just raw code and explanations.
