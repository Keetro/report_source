## Google Dataset Search: Making it Easier to Discover Datasets
> In today’s world, scientists in many disciplines and a growing number of journalists live and breathe data. There are many thousands of data repositories on the web, providing access to millions of datasets; and local and national governments around the world publish their data as well. To enable easy access to this data, we launched Dataset Search, so that scientists, data journalists, data geeks, or anyone else can find the data required for their work and their stories, or simply to satisfy their intellectual curiosity.

I spent a bit of time with it and was impressed. Another tool for your tool belt.

## Databook: Turning Big Data into Knowledge with Metadata at Uber
> Databook, Uber’s in-house platform for surfacing and managing contextual metadata, makes dataset discovery and exploration easier for teams across the company.
This is insanely cool. One of our beliefs recently from talking to hundreds of dbt users is that data discovery and knowledge dissemination has become a major problem at the most data-forward of organizations. The core problem is that with thousands of tables available in a data warehouse, it becomes harder and harder for data consumers to know exactly where exactly to go for information and to understand its provenance.

This post from Uber goes deep into Databook, their in-house solution for this problem. At the moment it doesn’t seem like Uber is planning on open sourcing Databook, but it’s still a fascinating example of what the most data-forward organizations are investing in.

## Data Dictionary: How To and Best Practices
> A data dictionary is a list of key terms and metrics with definitions, a business glossary. While it is sounds simple, almost trivial, its ability to align the business and remove confusion can be profound. In fact, a data dictionary is possibly one of the most valuable artifacts that a data team can deliver to the business.

What a boring topic, right? Who wants to think about data dictionaries, let’s build models! 

The author, Carl Anderson, used to run Data Science at Warby Parker and literally wrote the book on creating an amazing data organization. Sometimes the most useful things are the most basic.
